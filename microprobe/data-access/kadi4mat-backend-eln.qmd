title: 'Kadi4Mat backend ELN'
---

This section describes and documents the Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) backend used for the [epmatools](https://epmatools.streamlit.app/) frontend that allows users to access data of the JEOL JXA-8530F Plus electron-probe micro-analyser (EPMA) at the Institut für Geowissenschaften, Goethe Universität Frankfurt am Main.

# What is Kadi4Mat?

Kadi4Mat – or in short *Kadi* – is an Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) that we use for EPMA results management and making data FAIR. Kadi is an online system that can be accessed with only a browser. A login is might be possible through your university email (if the Shibboleth AAI is connected to Kadi) or by applying for an account. However, we use the Kadi Python API for our tools, and with these, no login to Kadi is necessary.


# Naming a Kadi record

Each record starts with 'GUF IfG EPMA'  
A single measurement session, i.e., the session of one party with a single set of samples can make use of different measurement programs, i.e., different measurement setups and parameters. For example, when first silicates and then sulphides are measured. In this case, the results have all the same name, but for each specific measurement program a separate record is created, with a lettered postfix in the form of: -a, -b, -c, ... The first record with the postfix -a contains files that are similar for all records with this name, e.g., overview images.  
Records of a single measurement session might be all put in a Kadi Collection.


# Quantitative Analyses  

## Must contain

*summary{date}.csv*  
The output from: summary, all, to excel, save as .csv  
  
*normal.txt*  
The output from: summary, normal, type out  
  
*summary standard.txt*  
The output from: summary, standard, type out  

*quick standard.txt*  
The output from: quick menu, right click recipe, ??  

  
## Can contain

### standard meausrements
standard measurements.xlsx
File with the results from the standard measurements, with colour results, therefore an excel file  
-> This file can (in rare cases) be missing, so it might be sensible to test for its availability and not if it is not available.

### Images
Files as .jpg, .tif, .bmp

# Map Analyses  

## Must contain

*quick standard.txt*  
The output from: quick menu, right click recipe, ??  

*{map file}.csv*  
The naming of {map file} is as follows:  
map {nr} {Eds}{internal designation} {element name} {measured characteristic line}.csv  
e.g.:  
map 2 data004 Mg Ka.csv  
note that 'Eds' only occurs when the element was measured with EDS, when 'Eds' is missing, the element was measured with WDS
  
## Can contain  

1 or 2 more map files labelled "data{nr} COMPO.csv" or "data{nr} SE.csv", which are maps of BSE- and/or SE-signals, i.e., essentially BSE- and SE-images.
Image files as .jpg, .tif, .bmp  


# Qualitative Analyses  

## Must contain

*summary{date}.csv*  
The output from: summary, all, to excel, save as .csv  
  
*normal.txt*  
The output from: summary, normal, type out  
  
*summary standard.txt*  
The output from: summary, standard, type out  

*quick standard.txt*  
The output from: quick menu, right click recipe, ??  


# Output

## Measurement Conditions
Detection limits (d.l.) are calculated by the machine software for each measurement point. The output in the webinterface is the median of all measurements togehter with the standard deviation.



# Flank Method Data
The same as in *Quantitative Data*, plus an offline corrected full summary file (csv).


# Upload
Upload all files to [Kadi4Mat](https://kadi4mat.iam-cms.kit.edu/login).

Provide additional, sensible info. Inivite the person to the respective group. Include the Kadi record in other, sensible groups.

<!-- # Definitions & Naming Conventions
## Campaign
A measurement sessions We call a measurement session What is a campaign, i.e., what files are part of a campaign?

What if one campaign uses different measurement parameters/programs?

store everything in one place

Each campaign becomes a sensible name, that is then also the record name on Kadi.
On Kadi, things are called 'record'.

## Kadi record PID naming
E.g.: guf-ifg-epma-NAME-NUMBER\
or:  guf-ifg-epma-NUMBER-NAME\
This should be documented together with the Kadi PID in an Excel file? Or could that be retrieved automatically?

A campaign is the same as a record, i.e., it beocmes a record once it is uploaded to Kadi

## Subsequent Naming
A number of files need to be produced and/or uploaded to Kadi. The file names in italic are mandator names, that need to be used exactly as given when these are uploaded to Kadi. The data processing web-interface requires exactly these names to work properly.
